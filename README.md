## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I'm highlighting this section because I need to keep practicing css grid and the properties it provides.

```css
figure{
      display: grid;
      grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
      justify-items: center;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about CSS, to know its properties very well, as well as to practice the Grid and Flexbox themes more

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This website helped me a lot with the CSS grid theme, I highly recommend it.

## Acknowledgments

I did this challenge alone, without anyone's help, more than the resources I occupied.
